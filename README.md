Use public IMDB data to perform analysis on movie investment and its profitability

Some initial analysis:

From the plot in excel, we could see that the fraction of which the domestic gross revenue contribute 
to the overall gross revene (that is DomGR+WWGR) decreases over the years, meaning that the international 
performance of a film very much determines it success.

I noticed that the data is clearly not evenly distributed, in fact it has a really long tail to the right. 
This means that most movie could have a ROI greater than 1, but very few managed to achieve and ROI that 
is way greater than 1 (for instance above 1000). There is quite a few movies that have an ROI that is 
smaller than 1. All of this information demonstrates the risky nature of investing in the movie industry.
